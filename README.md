# Discord League of Legends bot

A simple Discord bot for seeing League of Legends match stats directly in text channels. The purpose of this project is for me to learn Discord bot development and Riot APIs, so there is a lot of comments in the code.

## Current commands:
- **/latest-game-stats:** Responds with some stats from the most recent LoL match for a player.
