# LolBot

A simple Discord bot for seeing League of Legends match stats directly in text channels. The purpose of this project is to learn Discord bot development and Riot APIs, so there's a lot of comments in the code.

## Current commands:
- **/latest-game-stats:** Responds with some stats for a player from the most recent LoL match.
- **/latest-game-ability-stats:** Responds with some stats for a player regarding used abilities from the most recent LoL match.
- **/latest-game-lane-stats:** Responds with some stats for a player about the laning phase from the most recent LoL match.
